                            <p class="small-margin">CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial
                                websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law’s reach stretches well
                                beyond California to require any person or company in the United States (and conceivably
                                the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from
                                California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly
                                the information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being
                                shared.</p>
                            <p class="small-margin">Because we value your privacy, we have taken the necessary

                            <p class="small-margin">According to the California Online Privacy act, you have the
                                following rights:</p>
